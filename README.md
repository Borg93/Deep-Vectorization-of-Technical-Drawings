Official Pytorch repository for ECCV 2020 [Deep Vectorization of Technical Drawings]()
 
## Repository Structure

To increase user friendly for changes we decided to make repository module like.
The main modules are cleaning,vectorization,refinement and merging(each module has according folder).

* cleaning -
* vectorization -
* refinement - 
* merging - 
* dataset - 
* notebooks -  
* utils -
* scripts -
