## IMPORTANT
 
Because, this project is massive and I'm done code refactoring and restructuring for making user friendly repository with module like design
(to be easily modifiable and added new parts if needed),
not all functions are yet fully added and tested.Sorry for  inconvenience.
I'm currently working on it. I don't recommend to train or run this code yet,
but you can look at parts that you may interested with.  Datasets and files to compare are ready to be used. 
I will soon add trained model and will add readme and correct the code if needed to run smoothly.
See table below.

## Repository Structure

To increase user friendly for changes we decided to make repository module like.
The main modules are cleaning,vectorization,refinement and merging(each module has according folder).
Each folder has readme with more details. Here is brief content of each folder.

* cleaning - model,script to train and run, script to generate synthetic data 
* vectorization - NN models, script to train
* refinement - refinement module for curves and for lines
* merging - merging module for curves and for lines
* dataset - scripts to download ABC,PFP,cleaning datasets, scripts to modify data into patches and memory maped them.
* notebooks - playground to show some function in action
* utils - loss functions, rendering, metrics
* scripts - scripts to run training and evaluation

## Requirments
Linux system \
Python 3
Pytorch 1.3 \

## Compare 

If you want to compare with us without running code you can download our results on full pipeline on test set
for [pfp](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FGm-JQsvOa5sbi_f_-MMl1XC5Z8JGe0F/view?usp=sharing) and for 
[abc](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lR5lea3sY4Bhp9QL4MmmPs0kqZ5voPGu/view?usp=sharing) .
